          <p>Brain tumor is considered as one of the aggressive diseases, among children and adults. Brain tumors account for 85 to 90 percent of all primary Central Nervous System(CNS) tumors. Every year, around 11,700 people are diagnosed with a brain tumor. The 5-year survival rate for people with a cancerous brain or CNS tumor is approximately 34 percent for men and 36 percent for women. BrainTumors are classiﬁed as: Benign Tumor, Malignant Tumor, Pituitary Tumor, etc. Proper treatment planning and accurate diagnostics should be implemented to improve life expectancy of the patients.
            The best technique to detect brain tumor is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Huge amount of data images are generated through the scans. These images are examined by the radiologist. Manual examination can be error prone due to the level of complexities involved in brain tumors and their properties.
            Application of automated classiﬁcation techniques using Machine Learning(ML) and Artiﬁcial Intelligence(AI) has consistently shown higher accuracy than manual classiﬁcation.</p>
        
            <p>Hence, we propose performing detection and classiﬁcation by using Deep Learning Algorithms using Convolution Neural Network (CNN) to achieve higher accuracy.
              The MRI images are classiﬁed using different Deep Learning Models of CNN. The aim of the project is to achieve higher accuracy and reliability for real world MRI data using AI and ML domain knowledge. Further to accurately indicate positional change in tumor and to provide some suggestions for treatment by providing ease of access of the software through web browsers platforms.

          <p>A glioma is a type of tumor that starts in the glial cells of the brain or the spine. Gliomas comprise about 30 percent of all brain tumors and central nervous system tumours, and 80 percent of all malignant brain tumours.</p>

          <p>A malignant tumor contrasts with a non-cancerous benign tumor in that a malignancy is not self-limited in its growth, is capable of invading into adjacent tissues, and may be capable of spreading to distant tissues.</p>
